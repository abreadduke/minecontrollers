Numeration of pins goes by clockwise like in the picture on the left.$(br)To find out which pin belongs to which color, there is a simple math formula for this: $(bold)pin_number % 16$(), where % is division where you count only remainder (example 5 % 16 = 5; 18 % 16 = 2; 31 % 16 = 15). Result number is a code of color sheme of cables."
